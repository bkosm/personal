# How to get GitHub Copilot for free

We all know how impressive Copilot can be from all the various showcases and
free trials. Unfortunately after the free trial ends, you have to pay `$10`
per month to keep using it. It's tempting as it can save you a lot of time (even
allows to omit _Stack Overflow_ browsing at times) and (`#1` reason for me) it
can help with copywriting. Still, the price tag is there, and it might be a
bother for some. The good part is that you can get it for free and I'll show you
how.

## Free Copilot disclaimer

The official statement can be found
[here](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/overview-of-github-copilot/about-github-copilot#about-billing-for-github-copilot).
Basically everyone is eligible for a 60 day trial, but:

- verified students & teachers
- open-source maintainers

are eligible for free subscription. Period.

Remember that being a student at a verified university also grants you a free
GitHub Pro account. All you have to do is **add your university email to your
GitHub account as a secondary address** and there you go.

## What you need to do

According to the docs, besides being a scholar, you are also eligible for free
copilot if you're an _open source maintainer_. The docs are vague on this topic,
and only say that if you're qualified, you will get a notification when opening
the subscription page.

As I was notified exactly this way after the trial ended, I can share what I did
to achieve it.

## How I got it

Besides opening some issues on open-source projects (I would not assume just
opening issues makes you a _maintainer_) I did a contribution to a project that
I was researching for one of the faculties back when I was still studying. 

The grant came after I was no longer an active student. 

The contribution I did was
to a Python port of the terrier library
([merged PR](https://github.com/terrier-org/pyterrier/pull/261)). It was just a
small fix in the documentation. Basically the code snippet was incorrect and
caused an error when someone was trying to follow through the guide with running
the code along.

A good thing about contributing this way is that you don't have to be a git pro
to do it. Docs like these can be easily edited via the web UI and it also
automates the forking process.

If your change was meaningful in any way, it's super likely that it will be
merged.
